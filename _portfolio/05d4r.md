This study is our submission for the Data for Refugees (D4R) challenge where I have presented our results. In order to study possible segregation in the use modes of public spaces, I have constructed mobility networks based on a variable high-order network topology using an unprocessed 1.95GB Call Detail Record (CDR) dataset from 50k users. Study of locations on these networks revealed distinct differences of importance for these locations in the respective mobility networks. Our report can be found here, and an executive summary of findings from the challenge for policy makers can be found below.
