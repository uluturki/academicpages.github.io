Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at University of South Florida, studying technological and social networks. I am particularly interested in decentralized multi-agent cooperation and decision making. My current projects include collaborative trajectory control for a novel aerial Radio Access Network utilizing Reinforcement Learning, and studying the implications of the existence of social bots.

l also have extensive experience with hardware product development, RF and digital circuit design, and practical EMI issues and regulatory compliance. I have joined a startup as one of the first 10 employees and worked on the design and development of several products that are currently in the market throughout all stages of the product cycle.
