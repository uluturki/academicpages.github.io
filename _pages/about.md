Iâ€™m a recent PhD from University of South Florida, studying machine learning applications for technological and social networks. I am particularly interested in decentralized multi-agent cooperation and decision making. My current projects include collaborative trajectory control for a novel aerial Radio Access Network utilizing Reinforcement Learning, and studying the implications of the existence of social bots.

l also have extensive start-up industry research and development experience with a company developing healthcare RFID / IoT solutions where I joined as one of the first 10 employees, working on design and development of several products that are currently deployed in hospitals internationally throughout all stages of the product cycle.
