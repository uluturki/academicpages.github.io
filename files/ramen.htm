alt="Name: Girls, be ambitious!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Muse&#13;&#10;So Ra No Wo To Episode 7.5, Tactical Calvados spiked tea schnanigargles. Calvados also has an important part in multiple story archs through the entire show.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Abstract&#13;&#10; I'm basing my submission on an episode where characters unwittingly(!) drink tea spiked with Calvados (apple brandy from Normandy) that leads to further events and further Calvados drinking. Calvados also has a significant presence throughout the show. I have incorporated tea and calvados to both tare and the soup, as well as some powerful gimmicks to get Calvados aroma for service as aroma is specifically mentioned in the muse. Both the toppings and tare also include different preparations of apples, 4 in total (5 if you include Calvados), including &quot;petrified&quot; apples lightly sweetened and slowly braised both as is and dehydrated, and an apple+onion soffrito. Soup is also entirely tea, a combination of mugicha and hojicha. This is a chilled (but not fridge cold!) bowl that is also entirely vegan. I have made an optional cheese foam topping that works super well as well, however since it is unrelated to the muse, I won't include it.&#13;&#10;  &#13;&#10;Components of the bowl&#13;&#10;Noodles&#13;&#10;%36 hydration, %90 percent bread flour, %5 percent rice flour, %1.5 salt, %1.2 Sodium Carb, cut 1.2x1.5mm.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tare&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.png Machine generated alternative text:&#10;IVreally is goocL The fragrance is nice too. &#10;I know, right?

alt="Tare&#13;&#10;Cold Brewed Gyokuro, 200g: Nothing extra special, some middle of the road one. Brewed cold to limit the astringency while getting the most of the U M A M I. Gyokuro with just salt and msg is insane, try it sometime. &#13;&#10;  Calvados, 65g (45g cooked off, 20g as is): Used a younger (VSOP) Calvados because I wanted fruit aroma to be more prevalent. Older Calvados tend to get dominated by the barrel. Used both cooked off and directly in its 80proof glory.&#13;&#10; Apple syrup, 35g: This is the syrup from the braised apples used in the topping.  &#13;&#10; Salt, 50g&#13;&#10; MSG, 5g&#13;&#10;Keeping with the muse, the tare is made from tea and Calvados. This tare turned out way better than I expected, I'm definitely going to try it with more conventional soups next. It is made from:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Addition to Tare&#13;&#10;Each bowl gets a tablespoon of soffrito made from 1 part apples, 0.5 part onions, and a tiny bit of ginger, following Ivan Orkin's method. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aroma Oil&#13;&#10;Small amount of finishing EVOO. The residiual oil from the tbs of soffrito also contributes here. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Toppings&#13;&#10;1. Slow braised apples treated in a bath of calcium chloride, lightly sweetened. Calcium chloride allows to &quot;petrify&quot; an outer layer that stays intact and keeps texture through a 4 hour slow cook. This allows to have slices of apples that have a bite to them while having essentially jam/applesauce insides. I have based this on a traditional process common in south-eastern Turkey, however I've recently discovered that this is actually a signature dish at Mugaritz. I guess they know what's good too haha. See images on the right for how the inside looks.&#13;&#10;2. The smaller pieces of apple are the same as T1., however after the braise they are further cooked in the oven at 180oC for 45 minutes, and then dehydrated at as low as my oven goes for 2 hours, resulting in a chevier texture and intensified apple flavor. &#13;&#10;T3. Scallions.&#13;&#10;While it looks like there is only one topping in two different sizes, they are actually different products. The soup itself is not sweet, only a little to balance bitterness, and the idea is to give the diner to adjust their sweetness to their liking through bites of lightly sweetened braised apples. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Soup&#13;&#10;&quot;Soup&quot; is simply a mix of 200ml Mugicha + 100ml Hojicha. In the show they are drinking black tea, however I didn't want too much caffeine in there, and honestly it's a bit much. Mugicha provides the backbone and the bitterness to balance with the sweetness of the apples, and hojicha brings the aroma and flavor. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;Untitled picture.png Machine generated alternative text:&#10;IVreally is goocL The fragrance is nice too. &#10;I know, right?

alt="Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Assembly&#13;&#10;Right before service the edges of the bowls and the chopsticks get wiped with Calvados for aroma delivery, as it is an issue for chilled ramen and aroma is specifically mentioned in the muse. Calvados aroma doesn't last all the way to the end of the bowl of course, but does create an impact for your first bite that I like.&#13;&#10; The assembly of the ramen itself is 1tbs of the soffrito, 60ml of tare (a lot more than usual because it is chilled, it does need it I tried a whole range.), 200ml cold mugicha + 100ml warm hojicha, and cooked and shocked noodles, toppings, and serve. &#13;&#10;This bowl is served chilled, but not fridge cold. I achieve this by keeping all the ingredients in the fridge and add the hojicha freshly hot brewed to temper the coldness a bit. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Enjoy,&#13;&#10;Crusherdestroyer, PhD.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.jpg &#13;&#10;" src="ramen_files/mht1538(1).tmp" width=1264
