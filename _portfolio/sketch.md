I have worked on this project as an undergraduate visiting scholar at Koc University Intelligent User Interfaces group. I worked on translating freehand sketches of circuit schematics on paper to SPICE netlists. Lack of temporal information from the input method made component segmentation the main challenge. I worked on a dynamic programming based segmentation solution in Java.
