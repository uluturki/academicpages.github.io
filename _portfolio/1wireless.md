This project aims to implement a flexible aerial Radio Access Network (RAN) that can be rapidly deployed in previously unknown environments. This places a strong emphasis on the trajectory control of these Aerial Access Points, however a dynamic operating environment and limited prior knowledge of user mobility and traffic models makes tight closed-loop control an impractical luxury. While reasonable prior models may exist for fixed infrastructure networks, aerial networks are often considered for short-term temporary deployments such as post-disaster recovery where expecting prior models is unreasonable and online estimation of these models during operation is necessary. Iâ€™m using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address these challenges. My current focus is on decentralized learning and opportunistic cooperation of multiple RL agents.

Noticing a lack of publicly available simulation tools that can be used for benchmarks, I also started developing [gently](https://github.com/uluturki/gently), an open-sourced aerial wireless network simulator with a reinforcement learning environment written in Python. Main feature of gently is the inclusion of domain specific Wireless Networks details such as line-of-sight, channel models, interference, and traffic models. It is a work in progress and I hope to release v1.0 with my dissertation.
