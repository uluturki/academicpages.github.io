Hi! I am a PhD with a focus on applied Machine Learning and Data Science approaches for engineering problems, particularly on wireless and techno-social networks. I have a firm grasp of the entire stack from hardware and embedded software to web applications thanks to 9 years of industry research and development experience at 2 start-ups; both developing novel IoT solutions from ground-up that are currently deployed internationally. I especially enjoy multidisciplinary collaboration and interdisciplinary research.
