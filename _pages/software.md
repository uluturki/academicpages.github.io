Open-source projects where I am the lead author and maintainer. 

# [social-annotate](https://github.com/uluturki/twitter_annotate)
An open-sourced tool to simplify data annotation and collection from social media sites. We are taking great care to avoid isolating the annotation task from the regular use of the site, which allows users to collect and annotate data while experiencing the site normally. This also makes studying the user experience on the platform itself possible. One our main goals is to make this tool usable for researchers lacking technical know-how.

# [gently](https://github.com/uluturki/gently)
An open-sourced 3D Aerial Wireless Networks simulator with a reinforcement learning environment written in Python. Main feature of gently is the inclusion of domain specific Wireless Networks details such as line-of-sight, channel models, interference, and traffic models. It is a work in progress and I hope to release v1.0 with my dissertation.
