I am working on this project with [Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/), studying social bots, their detection, and implications of their existence. We have studied deception strategies for online discussions drawing parallels from history \[1\], and the relationship between social bots and journalists on twitter \[2\]. We are currently conducting a validation study on the publicly available social bot detection tools.

We are also developing [social-annotate](https://github.com/uluturki/twitter_annotate), an open-sourced tool to simplify data annotation and collection from social media sites. We are taking great care to avoid isolating the annotation task from the regular use of the site, which allows users to collect and annotate data while experiencing the site normally. This also makes studying the user experience on the platform itself possible. One our main goals is to make this tool usable for researchers lacking technical know-how.
