I have joined Skylo on January, 2021 as an Algorithm Engineer within the Advanced Networks and Algorithms team. Skylo is deploying the worldâ€™s most affordable and ubiquitous satellite-based IoT network that can connect any machine or sensor. My responsibilities as an Algorithm Engineer include designing and implementing algorithms, both for applications and the core NB-IoT(3GPP) network and often on resource constrained embedded platforms, to address challenges across the organization and providing specialist support to product and development teams. I often own and develop PoCs following business needs of the organization.  

Previously I was with [Borda Technology](https://www.bordatech.com/) as one of the first 10 employees, and had active part in the design and development of multiple products for healthcare IoT solutions including the entire Active RFID hardware. I have designed all the circuitry for low-power wearable active RFID devices (RF transponders), fixed anchor nodes, and active RFID to ethernet and WiFi gateways. I worked on the every stage of the product cycle, from initial concept to design, prototyping, validation, and mass-production, closely collaborating with interdisciplinary coworkers and external partners to ensure success. I led the efforts towards EM and regulatory compliance. I held internal lectures and trained interns within the Borda Academy internship program on subjects of practical engineering, EMC issues, and regulatory compliance. 

This project has received, among others, the best Heath-Care RFID Implementation award from RFID Journal Awards 2018.
